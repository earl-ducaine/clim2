** Description
   The contents of this repo are known to compile and work with the
   latest version of Allegro Express.  The short term goal is to get
   thing to work with CCL, then on other ANSI complient Common Lisps.

** Compilation Dependancies: Express Allegro and Ubuntu x86-32
   Install Expresss Allegro on Ubuntu x86-32 (It's know to work on
   Ubuntu 12.04 - 16.04).  Add alisp to the path using something like
   the following:

   1. cd ~/bin
   2. ln -s ~/acl100express/bin/alist .
   3. ln -s ~/acl100express/bin/alisp.dxl .

** Install Motif
   You'll also need to install the motif toolkit and build essentials.
   Something like the following on APT based systems:

   1. sudo apt-get install libmotif-dev
   2. sudo apt-get install libxt-dev
   3. sudo apt-get install build-essential

** Build motif wraper and copy library
   1. cd ~/clim2/c-src
   2. make
   3. cd ..
   4. ./cp-files.sh 

** Install quicklisp
   The easiest way to load things is by quicklisp.  First install
   quicklisp from the quicklisp website, configuring it for you
   Allegro Express installation.  Then link clim2

   1. cd ~/quickload/local-projects
   2. ln -s ~/clim2 .
   3. rm system-index.txt
   4. cd ~/clim2
   5. alist
   6. (ql:quickload :clim2)
   7. (clim-demo:start-demo)

** Testing
   (not currently operable.)
   1. start up alegro, e.g.
      alisp
   2. (load "load-clim")
   3. (load "clim-example")
