* Refactoring tk

** Allegro CL foreign interface (Motif library)
   All Allegro CL dependant Foreign interface stuff should be in this
   folder.  The following functions need to be wrapped

   - def-c-type
   - def-c-typedef
   - def-foreign-call
   - def-foreign-type
   - defun-foreign-callable
   - register-foreign-callable


** CFFI conversion

   All Allegro CL C foreign function calls should be wrapped in files
   called <alisp-fn>-wrapper.lisp.  The supcelia variable tk::use-cffi
   should be set to t and the project then recompiled.
